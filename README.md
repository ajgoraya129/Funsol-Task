# Funsol-Task
Number Plate Detection
As project was time bound and only 1 day was given so i was unable to vreate local dataset and had to download dataset from the internet.
Dataset has around 400 images with their label
InceptionResnetV2 was used
Model predicted the bounding box
Images is then cropped and by using pytesseract test is extracted from the image
I tried to attach the model.h5 file but it was too big(800mb)
